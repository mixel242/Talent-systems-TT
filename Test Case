Reported problem:
    As an amazon.com customer, I want a cart experience to be flawless.
    Recently it has been observed that there is some disconnect between quantity, and total price until I get to the checkout page.
    These problems have caused an increase in support tickets and buyers leaving the item in the cart and not finishing the purchase.
